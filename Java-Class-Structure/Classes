- Java is an object-oriented programming language, which
means it consists of classes and their methods

    Ex:
    * Class of students that have methods to solve a problem


Classes can be:
- public
- private
- protected
depending on the intended scope(whatever is inside curly braces of class)
    * declared by using on of those keywords
    * followed by 'class' and the name of class
